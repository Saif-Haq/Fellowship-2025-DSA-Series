## üí° Suggestions

- Make sure to prepare your notes alongside solving each problem.  
- Don‚Äôt spend more than 30‚Äì40 minutes on a single problem.  
- If you‚Äôre stuck on a problem, search on YouTube using the problem number.  
- Try to solve a problem in multiple ways.



Notes
(1)

Used a nested loop to calculate the sum from scratch for each index.
Was not accumulating the sum inside the inner loop.

Misusing push with brackets: output.push[s].

Improved Version (O(n) approach):
You correctly introduced a variable lastsum to carry the previously computed sum.
You pushed the new sum into the result array ‚Äî ‚úîÔ∏è nice.
But you forgot to update lastsum, so the same value kept being added repeatedly.

Final Fix:
Realized you needed to do: lastsum = newSum; after pushing the value.
With that one line, your logic became fully correct and efficient.
